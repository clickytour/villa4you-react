## Default rule
Use the homepage hero as the baseline template for all landing-page hero builds.

## Reuse across pages
- Keep the same hero layout structure.
- Keep core spacing rhythm and CTA hierarchy.
- Keep visual language consistent.

## Allowed per-page changes
- Hero copy (badge/title/subtitle).
- CTA labels.
- Trust bullets/chips.
- Right-side block type:
  - form
  - image
  - scheme/process block
- Supporting background image/overlay intensity.

- `/for-guests`
- `/for-owners`
- `/collaborate`

## Confluence approval rule
For every approved hero/page:
- Save the approval note in Confluence.
- Include preview link(s) used for approval (Vercel URL + route URLs where applicable).
- Keep links updated for future bot/agent handovers.

## Global consistency rule (Drcris)
For all upcoming pages, keep the same approved UI/UX/SEO/marketing style baseline to avoid rework.
Deviations require explicit override/approval.

## Process note
When starting any new hero session, begin from this baseline first, then apply page-specific adjustments.
This approved 6-hero set is the reusable starting point for future bots/agents.
